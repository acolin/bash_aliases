Rails Development Bash Aliases
============

Contains my basic bash aliases for rails development

## Install

1. Check a clone of this repo: `git clone http://github.com/revans/bash-it.git ~`
2. Insert the following lines in `~/.bashrc`

````
# Alias definitions.
# You may want to put all your additions into a separate file like
# ~/.bash_aliases, instead of adding them here directly.
# See /usr/share/doc/bash-doc/examples in the bash-doc package.

if [ -f ~/.bash_aliases ]; then
. ~/.bash_aliases
fi
````

3. Run `source ~/.bashrc`
