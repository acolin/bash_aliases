## Install

2. Insert the following lines in `~/.bashrc`

````
# Alias definitions.
# You may want to put all your additions into a separate file like
# ~/.bash_aliases, instead of adding them here directly.
# See /usr/share/doc/bash-doc/examples in the bash-doc package.

if [ -f ~/bash_aliases/.bash_aliases ]; then
. ~/bash_aliases/.bash_aliases
fi
